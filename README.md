# TextGameModel
To start building a text game model.
 
 This model needs several images and font. 
 You can download them with the files.
 Put them in a folder named 'imgs' and put it in a folder with code file. 
 !!!Remember to name the code file folder 'TextGame' !!!
 Test file is for testing, like it says. It seems having some problem.
 Please put the test file outside the 'TestGame' folder

Have a good day~
